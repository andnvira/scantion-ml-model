<h1 align="center"><strong>SCANTION</strong></h1>
<h3 align="center"><strong>üåüYour Friendly Skin Appüåü</strong></h3>

<hr>
Due to the lack of awareness regarding early detection of skin cancer, and the fact that many cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, we have developed an application called Scantion. This application aims to increase awareness among the public about early detection methods and reduce the severity of cancer cases. It is well-known that there has been a recent increase in the harmful effects of UV radiation from the sun, which can lead to skin cancer.

## Features

- Upload Images : The user can upload theis skin condition photo to see the result of skin detection in the app.
  <br>
- Update Article : An update information / article about melanoma. How to prevent melanoma cancer and Melanoma phenomena in the world.
  <br>
- Nearest Hospital Location : Detect our location so the application will recommend you to go to the nearest hospital at your location.

The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Jupyter Notebook is maintained by the people at Project Jupyter. Jupyter notebook also has so many advantages such as:

Kaggle allows users to find datasets they want to use in building AI models, publish datasets, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

Our team use kaggle to find our [Melanoma Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajghuwalewala/ham1000-segmentation-and-classification)
Also our team use other webistes to find [Normal Skin Datasets](https://id.depositphotos.com/stock-photos/human-skin-surface.html)

This repository contains source code of Machine Learning model classification of Scantion using CNN Method.
